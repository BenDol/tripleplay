    <h3>TriplePlay UI</h3>

    <p> <a href="https://github.com/threerings/tripleplay">TriplePlay</a>
    contains a UI framework (called TPUI for short) that provides many standard
    widgets for use in a PlayN game. This demo shows off some of the widgets
    and other user interface elements. </p>

    <h3>TriplePlay Demo</h3>

    <p> This is a live PlayN game, click away on it and feel the interactivity! </p>

    <div id="playn-root"></div>

    <p> It's a little haphazard because it tends to act as a testbed and a
    demo. If someone wants to create a more organized demo, that would be
    great! </p>

    <h3>Source code</h3>

    You can view the source code to each of the individual pages of the
    demo <a href="https://github.com/threerings/tripleplay/blob/master/demo/core/src/main/java/tripleplay">on
    Github</a>.
